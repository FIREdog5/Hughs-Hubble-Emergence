# Hughs-Hubble Emergence

In 3218 ad (earth gregorian calendar) the galaxy was swept by unprecedented cosmic radiation, originating from the merger of the galaxy's binary blackhole system and traveling many times faster than the speed of light. The event, known as the Hughs-Hubble cosmic storm was predicted to last over 75 years and had been anticipated by many years. Out of necessity worlds developed the means to survive the storm, and once they had the same technology would catapult them into the stars. When they got there they discovered that the Hughs-Hubble event had catalyzed development all across the galaxy, and that they were not alone.
